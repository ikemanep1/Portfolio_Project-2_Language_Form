  <div class="box">
    <p>The world of computer science is simply massive, with numerous pathways and career opportunities. Programming alone is divided into a series of "languages", each with their own rules of the road, uses, and communities.
      People who are new to the field of application development should pursue a specific language that they find interesting, useful to them, and/or both. Below is a partial list of programming languages, and a form to determine a good match for new programmers:</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: JavaScript is a common programming language that is used primarily to make web pages interactive. JavaScript is extremely easy to learn, and is ready-to-use by all browsers, making setup relatively hassle-free.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Ruby</strong>: Ruby is a general purpose, object-oriented, dynamic programming language. The language is highly popular, and is used to host world-renowned websites like Hulu, Github, and Kickstarter. The language is notable for its application testing capabilities.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>C#</strong>: C# is a combination of the pioneering C, and C++ languages. It is a compiled language, meaning that user-inputted code is converted to be machine-readible for efficiency and speed. C# is popular among videogame development communities.</li>
      </ul>
