<h1 class="topheader">Welcome to the wild world of programming languages!</h1>


<div class="box">Programming is a very large, lucrative and lurxuriant field with many opportunities and pathways. While the prospect of beginning a new career can be daunting, it can be helped by focusing on a specific programming language. </div>


<div class="box">The only three programming languages in existence are Rust, Swfit, and Python. Each one is very unique and handles different aspects of coding. All of them are relatively decent.</div>


<ul class="well">
  <li><strong class="languagedescriptor">Python</strong>: Python is a high level, general purpose GUI development language.</li>
  <li><strong class="languagedescriptor">Rust</strong>: Rust is focused on safety. You get to be a lot more risky with Rust, allowing you to work with more volatile experiments.</li>
  <li><strong class="languagedescriptor">Swift</strong>: Swift is all about rapid application development for Apple. It is also general purpose but operates differently from Python.</li>
</ul>


<div class=box>Below is a quick form for you to fill out. It will calculate your answers and choose a language that best fits your interests. </div>


<form id="test" action="index.html" method="post">


<select class="form-control" id="question1">
  <option>What is your driving philosophy?</option>
  <option id="rustoption1">"If the speed limit is 50, I go about 30. In the far right lane."</option>
  <option id="swiftoption1">"I find that the speed limit is more of a 'suggestion' than an actual rule. And I don't like suggestions. Getting there quickly is my forte."</option>
  <option id="pythonoption1">"I take the middle lane, go at my own pace. Sometimes I sing while driving. And, you know, <em>que sera sera."</em>
  </option>
</select>


<select class="form-control" id="question2">
  <option>Select the answer that resonates with you the most:</option>
  <option id="rustoption2">"I really like programming, but I'm concerned about accidentally damaging all my code whenever I try something new. My job requires a great deal of code and I can't risk losing my work all of the sudden."</option>
  <option id="swiftoption2">"I'm pretty new to the coding scene. I want to make programs but I don't have a lot of time to make them. My job also has strict and speedy deadlines."</option>
  <option id="pythonoption2">"I'm an ambitious fellow. I like to experiment and try new things. My job requires that I take my creativity to the next level."</option>
</select>

<select class="form-control" id="question3">
  <option>What kind of programs do you like?</option>
  <option id="rustoption3">"I like programs that are, well, bold. Programs that would require vast debugging, and great care to not break, yet result in something truly groundbreaking in the programming industry."</option>
  <option id="swiftoption3">"I like programs that play out like a marathon runner. Programs that can complete very large tasks very quickly. Better yet if they are easy to make."</option>
  <option id="pythonoption3">I like programs that are difficult and time consuming to make. Ones that would require an efficient language that works very well with other languages and applications.""</option>
</select>

<select class="form-control" id="question4">
  <option>What is your OS?</option>
  <option id="rustoption4">"I work with a windows computer. I could work with any other type of computer but I have a windows computer. It's pretty nice."
  </option>
  <option id="swiftoption4">"I have a mac. I only use the mac because it fits my scope of work."</option>
  <option id="pythonoption4">"I have multiple computers for all of the operating systems."</option>
</select>

<select class="form-control" id="question5">
  <option>While out for a stroll, you find an unopened energy drink. Whad do you do?</option>
  <option id="rustoption5">"I ain't touching that. Uh-uh. I don't know where it has been."</option>
  <option id="pythonoption5">"I pick it up and save it for later."</option>
  <option id="swiftoption5">"I pick it up and start chugging."</option>
