<h1 class="topheader">Welcome to the wild world of programming languages!</h1>


<div class="box">Programming is a very large, lucrative and lurxuriant field with many opportunities and pathways. While the prospect of beginning a new career can be daunting, it can be helped by focusing on a specific programming language. </div>


<div class="box">The only three programming languages in existence are Rust, Swfit, and Python. Each one is very unique and handles different aspects of coding. All of them are relatively decent.</div>


<ul class="well">
  <li><strong class="languagedescriptor">Python</strong>: Python is a high level, general purpose GUI development language.</li>
  <li><strong class="languagedescriptor">Rust</strong>: Rust is focused on safety. You get to be a lot more risky with Rust, allowing you to work with more volatile experiments.</li>
  <li><strong class="languagedescriptor">Swift</strong>: Swift is all about rapid application development for Apple. It is also general purpose but operates differently from Python.</li>
</ul>


<div class=box>Below is a quick form for you to fill out. It will calculate your answers and choose a language that best fits your interests. </div>
